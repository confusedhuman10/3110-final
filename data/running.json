This felt quite okay, I guess I could have gone faster if I had not been alone.\n\nI have a 10k race next saturday and I was originally aiming at going sub 45, which feels like very easily doable now. I'm not sure if I should adjust my goal, because I think that with tapering and so on in the last week I could go quite a bit faster, given the random 5k time today.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas about pacing?

Hope this is interesting and helpful to anyone who's thinking about it.\n\n**Some background:**\n\nI've run a bunch of half marathons before, and one full: NYC in 2019. It was brutal. I completely tanked in the last 6 miles. Full body cramps, nausea, almost barfed in front of 100 spectators, etc but I did manage to trudge across the finish line. I had a goal of 3:30 and ended up finishing in 3:47.\n\nThis year, I was ready to give it another shot, and had heard great things about the Hansons method from a coworker who knows his stuff.\n\n**The method:**\n\nI used the advanced plan with a time goal of 3:20. This was a pretty arbitrary goal, roughly based on how I've performed in previous half marathons (PR of around 1:30). I figured the time goal was a moving target, and I'd see how it went through the training process.\n\nI followed the plan pretty much to the letter, except for a handful of workouts in weeks 9/10 that I missed due to a bad cold.\n\nThe high mileage weeks were *exhausting*, and I found the early speed workouts to be especially difficult. I felt like I was consistently on the brink of over-exhaustion, but never to the point where I felt injured or like I needed time off. My legs were always beat but I always felt good enough to complete the workouts. I think this is a major testament to the plan.\n\nI ate gels during the longer workouts so my body could get accustomed to it, and prioritized getting decent sleep. I incorporated regular strength training from [this book](https://www.velopress.com/books/quick-strength-for-runners/), which I'm a big fan of. I didn't make any major dietary changes (I eat reasonably well as is).\n\n**The race:**\n\nI ran Chicago, and was excited about the flat course. The weather was gross \u2014 super humid and in the mid 70s. Overall I felt extremely well prepared going into the race. The plan had gotten me into a place where I was running on auto-pilot and feeling like a machine.\n\nI ate gels according to this [interesting study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045035/) (much more than I ate in 2019), which I trialed during training to make sure it agreed with my system. I also drank 2 or 3 cups of water at every station (like I said it was humid as shit). I think lack of hydration was a major problem in my first marathon.\n\nI fell into my goal pace and kept remarkably consistent splits, finishing in 3:19 (1:40 half marathon, with a little sprint for the last mile). I felt great the whole time. It's hard to overstate how different this was from my first marathon.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe plan really made me a believer. Next time, I'm going to be a little more flexible with my goal time. I want to try out different pace targets and find one that feels right, rather than picking an arbitrary pace and sticking to it so doggedly. Maybe I'll also try to be more intentional with nutrition. Otherwise, no real critiques. The race went almost eerily according to plan and was very enjoyable.",

          "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nA few days ago I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/q8qzro/what_was_your_experience_transitioning_from_half/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) asking for tips and personal experiences from others who've transitioned from running half marathons to running marathons. I received so many great responses, so first, a huge thank you to this community!  \n\nI decided to write this update because I noticed several  comments in my previous post from folks who felt discouraged and disappointed after reading others' feedback. \n\nWell, I followed some of the tips I got and yesterday I was able to complete my first 25 km run! What I did differently:\n-I paced myself and ran slower than usual (it usually takes me 2h20-2h30 mins to complete a HM, yesterday it took me 2h40 mins);\n\n-I drank water during my run. I bought a little bottle that I could fit in my fanny pack, and I drank a bit at 14kms; 17 kms; and again at 19 kms. It was 9 ounces of water in total.

I looked down at my apple watch and saw my heart rate was in the 120s.  From the very high intensity workout of cleaning my basement.  I was a sedentary, desk bound guy who loved to eat and play video games and clocked in at 325 lbs on my 5'10\" frame with blood sugars creeping up, sleep apnea, etc.  None of that mattered though, all that mattered was I was a mid 30s guy who was getting worn down by vacuuming my basement.\n\nI knew I could not continue like this.  I was just married a month prior and I was looking at leaving my wife alone at young age.  Well I dedicated myself to getting stronger.  I started eating better and exercising and got my weight down to about 250lbs before I started C25K in late winter/spring of 2019.  My running segments were slow, usually about 13 min miles and a cadence in the 140s (per my watch).  I ran my first 10K in July/2019 at a 12:10 min/mile and a half marathon in October 2019 in a 9:50 min/mile (beating my pace goal by 10 seconds/mile).  I was ecstatic to run that fast for the half but the concept of a marathon seemed very daunting.  I signed up for the Marine Core Marathon in 2020 with a goal just to finish.   It was canceled for obvious reasons so I deferred to 2021.  Between the half marathon and dedicated Training for the marathon (July 2021) I kind of ran to keep my fitness up and keep my sane during the pandemic.  At this point my weight had gotten down and stabilized around 170lbs.  One thing that wasn't happening is that I wasn't really getting any faster.\n\nTraining Started July of this year for the 2021 Marine Core Marathon and I followed a Hal Higdons Novice 2 Plan which included specifically runs at a faster pace.  I wasn't very good at setting a faster pace for myself (my training runs alone would always drop into the 11min/mile plus range) so I joined a couple local run groups so I could run with people who considered a 10 min/mil their recovery pace once a week.  I was constantly feeling sore and injured (hips and knees especially) during the first 8 weeks of the plan even though the plan had less volume then I'm used to running on my own.  I thought I would push through the plan and the race, finish a marathon, and never do this again.  In Week 8 or 9, I felt a really sharp pain in my foot and I skipped a run in the plan for the first time (a 3 miler).  I felt better a few days later and did my long run of around 10 miles or so.\n\nSomething magical happened, then almost all of my pain issues disappeared.  I didn't have any serious pain or injuries for almost the entire second half of the plan even though I was increasing volume and still doing runs with the run group.  My pace started getting a little faster, I would be able to keep a sub 9 min/mile pace for about the first 5k of our group runs, but would fall back to the mid 9s by the end of a 10K run.  This 4 hour time everyone talks about seemed crazy to me.  No way I can maintain 9:09 for 26 freaking miles when I can barely do it for a 5K.\n\nI was 6 weeks from the race and two weeks from my 20 miles long run in the plan when I got news that the MCM had canceled it's live event for 2021 as well.  I was devastated and after sitting in my car nearly bawling my eyes out, I knew I had to find a new race.  I wanted to do a race in a location that was special to me.  I picked the MCM because I lived in DC for 6 years and it's where I started my career.  I considered Detroit, since it was where I grew up, but didn't because 1) It's where I ran the half 2) COVID restrictions meant that the best part of the race (the international crossing) would not occur this year.  I finally settled on Denver, because it is a city I love and where I plan to live for a very long time.  I did most of my training in the Denver area, so the altitude wouldn't be a problem for me.  The only problem was that it was 2 weeks earlier than the MCM and I had scheduled the training without any wiggle room.  I posted on this sub basically asking if it was a stupid idea to skip two weeks of training and the responses were encouraging.  I converted the 19 mile I had planned for that weekend into a 20 miler and ran it without much issue.  I started a taper right after the 20 miler.\n\nThe first week of taper went fine (didn't really see that much of a reduction in volume), but I had a very sore hip seemingly out of nowhere.  My injuries were back!  I was terrified that I had sprained something on a run.  I dropped one session a week for the last two weeks of taper (running three days instead of 4/week) and the hip soreness slowly went away for the most part.  It's the night before the marathon, and I freaking BURN the back of cheek with hot soup!  I was scrambling thinking I'm gonna need to find an emergency dentist.  My wife calmed me down and told me that I'm not straining the inside of my mouth while running and Gu gel won't hurt.  Something had to go wrong.  Now to the race!\n\n**Race**\n\nI \"snuck\" up one corral higher than my bib since that's where the 4:00 hour pacer was, my goal was to stick to him as long as I possibly could.  In the beginning I felt great, I could have easily pushed my pacer and built a buffer, but everything I've read on this sub and online says not to do that, so I didn't.  If I got a little ahead of him, I slowed down.  If I got a little behind him, I speed up.  I walked a bit through every aide station.  I had my packs of gummy bears and gu gels and was taking them like I did during my training (btw, gels are awful, wish I could race fuel with donuts) .  I was feeling great, high fived my wife and pet my dog around mile 8.  Started feeling a little bloated from water around mile 10, but otherwise great.\n\nI stuck to that pacer for the first 17 miles, he never left my sight.  Around mile 17, the slope was gently downhill (about a 1% grade) so I thought this was the perfect time to push past the pacer a bit and maybe start building a buffer.  The grade drop ended right around Mile 20 or so when the race went through the Denver Broncos stadium for the second time.\n\nWhen exiting the stadium, my legs, quads, and everything just started feeling sore.  I was still maintaining speed for the most part but felt like I was running in sand with still a 10K to go.  Each mile seemed to take forever.  It's not joke when I say it felt like the last 10K took longer than the first 20 miles.  Whenever the course would start an uphill segment, my calves would feel like they were on the verge of hard cramping despite the Gatorade and gels.  I felt like if I pushed a bit to hard, my calves would just seize.  My pacer caught up and passed me about mile 24 during one of these uphill segments.  I was regretting my push at mile 17, mentally I was kicking myself thinking I should have stayed with him until at least mile  24 or so.  I passed the 2 mile left mark feeling like I was giving every ounce of effort I had to maintain as fast a pace as possible.  I looked down at my watch as I passed the 2 miles left mark and saw I was at 3:41:50.  A little mental math means I only needed to do a 9 minute mile for the last two miles assuming the markers were accurate.\n\nI was passing a lot of people who had started walking by this point.  Even though, the only people who passed me were the relay runners, my pacer was getting further ahead of me (I guess he was negative splitting, I never saw him again after this).  I passed the 1 mile to go mark at 3:50 and change.  I passed 26 miles roughly at 3:57 or 3:58 (can't quite remember) and change on the watch.  It was going to be close.  I gave everything I had left (which felt like practically nothing) at that point.  The finish line was just ahead, and I dead sprinted  as fast as I could.  My vision went all blurry,  I didn't even see my wife and dog at the finish line, It actually felt like I was running even slower than before even though I could tell my feet were moving faster the finish line seemed to approach slower as I got closer.  If I had died in those last 100 feet, I wouldn't have regretted it because I would have went out literally giving every ounce of myself to that finish.  I went from that guy who couldn't vacuum his basement without taking a break to finishing a marathon with everything he had.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI stopped my watch  at 3:59:47 and surprisingly didn't collapse into a crumple of failing leg muscles.  I was happy to finish and got some water (I couldn't eat anything else they had at the finish as my stomach wouldn't let me).  I could barley keep my balance, I would slightly stumble to one side or the other as I was walking down to corral with my medal.  I was on cloud nine for having finished, but felt slightly worried if I did break 4 hours.  It was so close, maybe there was a timing issue or something like that.  After meeting my wife, I did a five minute stretching session and went to the official results booth and I typed my name in.\n\nI saw the magical 3:59:41 and would have jumped for joy had I been able too.  We walked back to our car at a very slow pace and pretty much went straight home.  We got some donuts delivered and finally I had my race fuel of choice from Voodoo Donuts!  What I remember the most about the post race experience was the brain fog.  I don't think I could even do basic math at that point.  I'm guessing due to low blood sugar.  I even got one of my wife's donuts wrong since I was ordering while she was driving, but she forgave me.\n\nLooking at my individual mile paces on my watch after the race, I realized I actually ran miles 24-Finish at the fastest pace of any miles in the entire race.  They were all sub 9 minutes.  Even though I felt like I was running slower than my easiest training runs.\n\nI collapsed into bed with my phone and a couple of donuts and didn't move much for the rest of the day with my legs feeling shot.  We're now about 48 hours post race and my legs actually feel about 75% recovered.  I'm still not planning on a run for a couple of days.  Maybe I'll clean out my basement again.  What I will certainly do is set a new goal, maybe defer to MCM to 2022, but this post race feeling is addictive.  I've already started watching videos and reading up on various strategies to improve even more.  I might starting with zero drop/low stack shoes mixed in to build up some foot strength (I've been running in Hokas since the start).

I looked down at my apple watch and saw my heart rate was in the 120s.  From the very high intensity workout of cleaning my basement.  I was a sedentary, desk bound guy who loved to eat and play video games and clocked in at 325 lbs on my 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot; frame with blood sugars creeping up, sleep apnea, etc.  None of that mattered though, all that mattered was I was a mid 30s guy who was getting worn down by vacuuming my basement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I could not continue like this.  I was just married a month prior and I was looking at leaving my wife alone at young age.  Well I dedicated myself to getting stronger.  I started eating better and exercising and got my weight down to about 250lbs before I started C25K in late winter/spring of 2019.  My running segments were slow, usually about 13 min miles and a cadence in the 140s (per my watch).  I ran my first 10K in July/2019 at a 12:10 min/mile and a half marathon in October 2019 in a 9:50 min/mile (beating my pace goal by 10 seconds/mile).  I was ecstatic to run that fast for the half but the concept of a marathon seemed very daunting.  I signed up for the Marine Core Marathon in 2020 with a goal just to finish.   It was canceled for obvious reasons so I deferred to 2021.  Between the half marathon and dedicated Training for the marathon (July 2021) I kind of ran to keep my fitness up and keep my sane during the pandemic.  At this point my weight had gotten down and stabilized around 170lbs.  One thing that wasn&amp;#39;t happening is that I wasn&amp;#39;t really getting any faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training Started July of this year for the 2021 Marine Core Marathon and I followed a Hal Higdons Novice 2 Plan which included specifically runs at a faster pace.  I wasn&amp;#39;t very good at setting a faster pace for myself (my training runs alone would always drop into the 11min/mile plus range) so I joined a couple local run groups so I could run with people who considered a 10 min/mil their recovery pace once a week.  I was constantly feeling sore and injured (hips and knees especially) during the first 8 weeks of the plan even though the plan had less volume then I&amp;#39;m used to running on my own.  I thought I would push through the plan and the race, finish a marathon, and never do this again.  In Week 8 or 9, I felt a really sharp pain in my foot and I skipped a run in the plan for the first time (a 3 miler).  I felt better a few days later and did my long run of around 10 miles or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something magical happened, then almost all of my pain issues disappeared.  I didn&amp;#39;t have any serious pain or injuries for almost the entire second half of the plan even though I was increasing volume and still doing runs with the run group.  My pace started getting a little faster, I would be able to keep a sub 9 min/mile pace for about the first 5k of our group runs, but would fall back to the mid 9s by the end of a 10K run.  This 4 hour time everyone talks about seemed crazy to me.  No way I can maintain 9:09 for 26 freaking miles when I can barely do it for a 5K.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was 6 weeks from the race and two weeks from my 20 miles long run in the plan when I got news that the MCM had canceled it&amp;#39;s live event for 2021 as well.  I was devastated and after sitting in my car nearly bawling my eyes out, I knew I had to find a new race.  I wanted to do a race in a location that was special to me.  I picked the MCM because I lived in DC for 6 years and it&amp;#39;s where I started my career.  I considered Detroit, since it was where I grew up, but didn&amp;#39;t because 1) It&amp;#39;s where I ran the half 2) COVID restrictions meant that the best part of the race (the international crossing) would not occur this year.  I finally settled on Denver, because it is a city I love and where I plan to live for a very long time.  I did most of my training in the Denver area, so the altitude wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem for me.  The only problem was that it was 2 weeks earlier than the MCM and I had scheduled the training without any wiggle room.  I posted on this sub basically asking if it was a stupid idea to skip two weeks of training and the responses were encouraging.  I converted the 19 mile I had planned for that weekend into a 20 miler and ran it without much issue.  I started a taper right after the 20 miler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first week of taper went fine (didn&amp;#39;t really see that much of a reduction in volume), but I had a very sore hip seemingly out of nowhere.  My injuries were back!  I was terrified that I had sprained something on a run.  I dropped one session a week for the last two weeks of taper (running three days instead of 4/week) and the hip soreness slowly went away for the most part.  It&amp;#39;s the night before the marathon, and I freaking BURN the back of cheek with hot soup!  I was scrambling thinking I&amp;#39;m gonna need to find an emergency dentist.  My wife calmed me down and told me that I&amp;#39;m not straining the inside of my mouth while running and Gu gel won&amp;#39;t hurt.  Something had to go wrong.  Now to the race!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;snuck&amp;quot; up one corral higher than my bib since that&amp;#39;s where the 4:00 hour pacer was, my goal was to stick to him as long as I possibly could.  In the beginning I felt great, I could have easily pushed my pacer and built a buffer, but everything I&amp;#39;ve read on this sub and online says not to do that, so I didn&amp;#39;t.  If I got a little ahead of him, I slowed down.  If I got a little behind him, I speed up.  I walked a bit through every aide station.  I had my packs of gummy bears and gu gels and was taking them like I did during my training (btw, gels are awful, wish I could race fuel with donuts) .  I was feeling great, high fived my wife and pet my dog around mile 8.  Started feeling a little bloated from water around mile 10, but otherwise great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck to that pacer for the first 17 miles, he never left my sight.  Around mile 17, the slope was gently downhill (about a 1% grade) so I thought this was the perfect time to push past the pacer a bit and maybe start building a buffer.  The grade drop ended right around Mile 20 or so when the race went through the Denver Broncos stadium for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When exiting the stadium, my legs, quads, and everything just started feeling sore.  I was still maintaining speed for the most part but felt like I was running in sand with still a 10K to go.  Each mile seemed to take forever.  It&amp;#39;s not joke when I say it felt like the last 10K took longer than the first 20 miles.  Whenever the course would start an uphill segment, my calves would feel like they were on the verge of hard cramping despite the Gatorade and gels.  I felt like if I pushed a bit to hard, my calves would just seize.  My pacer caught up and passed me about mile 24 during one of these uphill segments.  I was regretting my push at mile 17, mentally I was kicking myself thinking I should have stayed with him until at least mile  24 or so.  I passed the 2 mile left mark feeling like I was giving every ounce of effort I had to maintain as fast a pace as possible.  I looked down at my watch as I passed the 2 miles left mark and saw I was at 3:41:50.  A little mental math means I only needed to do a 9 minute mile for the last two miles assuming the markers were accurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was passing a lot of people who had started walking by this point.  Even though, the only people who passed me were the relay runners, my pacer was getting further ahead of me (I guess he was negative splitting, I never saw him again after this).  I passed the 1 mile to go mark at 3:50 and change.  I passed 26 miles roughly at 3:57 or 3:58 (can&amp;#39;t quite remember) and change on the watch.  It was going to be close.  I gave everything I had left (which felt like practically nothing) at that point.  The finish line was just ahead, and I dead sprinted  as fast as I could.  My vision went all blurry,  I didn&amp;#39;t even see my wife and dog at the finish line, It actually felt like I was running even slower than before even though I could tell my feet were moving faster the finish line seemed to approach slower as I got closer.  If I had died in those last 100 feet, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have regretted it because I would have went out literally giving every ounce of myself to that finish.  I went from that guy who couldn&amp;#39;t vacuum his basement without taking a break to finishing a marathon with everything he had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped my watch  at 3:59:47 and surprisingly didn&amp;#39;t collapse into a crumple of failing leg muscles.

          "selftext": "I know lots of folks have races coming up, so I wanted to share my recent experience in case it helps anyone. \n\nI recently ran a half marathon after training since April. While I was running consistently and stuck to a gradual plan very well until the end of July, I really slipped up during August and September. I was running but not as frequently, and I didn\u2019t stick to my plan due to multiple things that came up (getting sick for a week, moving apartments, grad school application deadlines, etc.).\n\nSo basically, I knew that I wasn\u2019t fully ready. The most I ran beforehand was one 8 miler and one 9 miler a few weeks beforehand. I had mostly been running 3-6 mile runs otherwise. But I wanted to stick to it and took reassurance from the many posts of people successfully running a half without training at that distance. And I will say - I did finish. And in the moment I was proud of myself and glad I did it. \n\nBut soon after, my foot started to hurt when I was walking. Now, a week later, it\u2019s slightly better but I haven\u2019t been able to walk around my neighborhood without pain, let alone run. I have a vacation coming up in a few days where we wanted to hike a few days - that\u2019s likely now off the table. I also really want to get back to running to keep myself sane, but I can\u2019t do that yet. I may need to go to a doctor soon.\n\nIn retrospect, the finisher medal doesn\u2019t feel worth being injured for what will probably be at least a few weeks. I feel like sometimes we treat races as the ultimate finish line where you push past your comfort zone and any pain. But it shouldn\u2019t mean injuring yourself and making impossible to keep running for enjoyment. There are always other races.\n\nIt\u2019s a personal decision for everyone, but we just need to keep in mind the risks of running unprepared - it\u2019s not necessarily just the short-term pain. There\u2019s no shame in sitting out a race and changing plans. \n\nTLDR: I ran a HM under-prepared and now my foot is injured. Keep injury risks in mind when making a judgment call on racing if you\u2019re on the fence.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know lots of folks have races coming up, so I wanted to share my recent experience in case it helps anyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently ran a half marathon after training since April. While I was running consistently and stuck to a gradual plan very well until the end of July, I really slipped up during August and September. I was running but not as frequently, and I didn\u2019t stick to my plan due to multiple things that came up (getting sick for a week, moving apartments, grad school application deadlines, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, I knew that I wasn\u2019t fully ready. The most I ran beforehand was one 8 miler and one 9 miler a few weeks beforehand. I had mostly been running 3-6 mile runs otherwise. But I wanted to stick to it and took reassurance from the many posts of people successfully running a half without training at that distance. And I will say - I did finish. And in the moment I was proud of myself and glad I did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But soon after, my foot started to hurt when I was walking. Now, a week later, it\u2019s slightly better but I haven\u2019t been able to walk around my neighborhood without pain, let alone run. I have a vacation coming up in a few days where we wanted to hike a few days - that\u2019s likely now off the table. I also really want to get back to running to keep myself sane, but I can\u2019t do that yet. I may need to go to a doctor soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the finisher medal doesn\u2019t feel worth being injured for what will probably be at least a few weeks. I feel like sometimes we treat races as the ultimate finish line where you push past your comfort zone and any pain. But it shouldn\u2019t mean injuring yourself and making impossible to keep running for enjoyment. There are always other races.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a personal decision for everyone, but we just need to keep in mind the risks of running unprepared - it\u2019s not necessarily just the short-term pain. There\u2019s no shame in sitting out a race and changing plans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I ran a HM under-prepared and now my foot is injured. Keep injury risks in mind when making a judgment call on racing if you\u2019re on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Lately, I had been neglecting my health and put on weight, while letting my muscles just atrophy at my desk job. Just before COVID hit, my posture was so bad that I had two useless rotator cuffs. I couldn\u2019t lift 3 pounds without having searing pain in my shoulders. I started physical therapy, but it was cut short by COVID. Later, my dad became an \u201cearly adopter\u201d and nearly died from COVID during the first month of the pandemic. This finally made me get serious about changing my lifestyle and prioritizing my health. I\u2019ve got 2 kids (soon to be 3) and I\u2019ve got a lot to live for. I took up running and trained for the 2020 Detroit half marathon (virtual). Admittedly, I didn\u2019t train very hard and my form still sucked, but I finished it and it felt amazing to accomplish something that previously seemed impossible. I dieted and lost about 20 pounds. I then went back to physical therapy and (mostly) fixed my shoulders. I decided it was time to set my sights higher and register for the full marathon. I trained with a Peloton audio program for 19 weeks. It was a great program for first timers like me. I didn\u2019t take my training lightly this time and really improved my form. I was still slow, but I had great endurance and cardiovascular fitness. Before I knew it, I was running 10-20 miles as just a Saturday morning routine. I also went back to physical therapy to fix some minor hip issues. \n\n### Pre-race - I was feeling kind of restless during my taper. But I had finished my 20 mile long run (the longest of my training program) without incident and got a huge confidence boost from it. I managed to poop about 20 minutes before the start, which was a major concern for me. On the morning before the marathon, I tweaked a muscle in my upper back and had to do damage control with heat and ice. I showed up to the starting line only slightly nervous. I was confident and ready to get rolling. \n\n### Race - This was my first real race and I made the rookie mistake of starting out too fast. I knew this was a no-no, but honestly it just felt weird running with fresh legs. At times, I was run a full minute faster than my goal pace. Oops. Eventually, my legs began to tire and I was my goal pace out of necessity. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t suffer from the usual cramps and muscle tightness that ordinarily plagued me (neck, shoulders, abdominals). Seeing my wife and kids around mile 14 was a huge confidence boost. I didn\u2019t struggle until miles 20-25, which were rough. I had to take a few short walking breaks just to rest my legs. I started tearing up as soon as I turned the corner and saw the finish line. I finished with tears streaming down my face and met my family. \n\n### Post-race - I hung out with my family and pigged out on snacks. I felt surprisingly energetic. My time is nothing to phone home about, but damnit I\u2019m proud. I\u2019ve got room to improve, no doubt. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to run a full marathon next year because the wife and I are expecting a new baby in a couple months. But I want to maintain my gains and pack on some muscle over the winter. I\u2019ll probably run a half next year. But next time I run 26.2\u2026 look out\u2026 I\u2019m aiming to shave a full hour off my time. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

Lately, I had been neglecting my health and put on weight, while letting my muscles just atrophy at my desk job. Just before COVID hit, my posture was so bad that I had two useless rotator cuffs. I couldn\u2019t lift 3 pounds without having searing pain in my shoulders. I started physical therapy, but it was cut short by COVID. Later, my dad became an \u201cearly adopter\u201d and nearly died from COVID during the first month of the pandemic. This finally made me get serious about changing my lifestyle and prioritizing my health. I\u2019ve got 2 kids (soon to be 3) and I\u2019ve got a lot to live for. I took up running and trained for the 2020 Detroit half marathon (virtual). Admittedly, I didn\u2019t train very hard and my form still sucked, but I finished it and it felt amazing to accomplish something that previously seemed impossible. I dieted and lost about 20 pounds. I then went back to physical therapy and (mostly) fixed my shoulders. I decided it was time to set my sights higher and register for the full marathon. I trained with a Peloton audio program for 19 weeks. It was a great program for first timers like me. I didn\u2019t take my training lightly this time and really improved my form. I was still slow, but I had great endurance and cardiovascular fitness. Before I knew it, I was running 10-20 miles as just a Saturday morning routine. I also went back to physical therapy to fix some minor hip issues.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race - I was feeling kind of restless during my taper. But I had finished my 20 mile long run (the longest of my training program) without incident and got a huge confidence boost from it. I managed to poop about 20 minutes before the start, which was a major concern for me. On the morning before the marathon, I tweaked a muscle in my upper back and had to do damage control with heat and ice. I showed up to the starting line only slightly nervous. I was confident and ready to get rolling.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Race - This was my first real race and I made the rookie mistake of starting out too fast. I knew this was a no-no, but honestly it just felt weird running with fresh legs. At times, I was run a full minute faster than my goal pace. Oops. Eventually, my legs began to tire and I was my goal pace out of necessity. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t suffer from the usual cramps and muscle tightness that ordinarily plagued me (neck, shoulders, abdominals). Seeing my wife and kids around mile 14 was a huge confidence boost. I didn\u2019t struggle until miles 20-25, which were rough. I had to take a few short walking breaks just to rest my legs.

I haven't really focused on a training plan, so no tempos or workouts. Recently, I've been trying to run about 4 or 5 times a week with 3 or 4 of those daily runs being about 5 miles and have just reintroduced a \"long run\" of 7. I typically run at an 8 minute mile pace, ranging from 7:45 to 8:15 depending on the day.\n\nI'm thinking I'll start reintroducing workouts and tempos into my life but now I'm unsure what a good goal for me might be. I want to go sub 20 again. But I really don't remember how hard or easy it is to do that. Is it something I could do if I signed up for a 5k in a month? Has anyone taken a long break from running and come back and either struggled to hit their old goals or got right back into it?\n\nSorry if this is a low effort post, I'm just curious as to what others think.",

I typically run at an 8 minute mile pace, ranging from 7:45 to 8:15 depending on the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking I&amp;#39;ll start reintroducing workouts and tempos into my life but now I&amp;#39;m unsure what a good goal for me might be. I want to go sub 20 again. But I really don&amp;#39;t remember how hard or easy it is to do that. Is it something I could do if I signed up for a 5k in a month? Has anyone taken a long break from running and come back and either struggled to hit their old goals or got right back into it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is a low effort post, I&amp;#39;m just curious as to what others think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nI started running about a year ago. At first, I just considered it a form of cardio to do before strength training at home. After a couple of runs I discovered that I felt brilliant when running and after a run. Nevertheless, I didn't stick to it. I ran and trained for a month, then stopped for two months, then ran for two months and stopped... The cycle repeated itself for a year  approximately.\n\nThen I came home from holiday this summer and got a surprise call from a friend that I knew from kindergarten. We went for a drink, and figured out that we both loved to run. We went for a couple of runs on the beautiful riverbank in our city, Zagreb. Soon we figured out we could run 8km comfortably. The hype and power we felt was unreal. We immediately signed up for a half marathon five weeks away.\n\nThe more we ran, the more we started to fall in love with long distance running, cherishing every evening when we would go and sweat and talk and talk mile after mile after mile. Our goal was just to finish the half marathon. We trained according to Hal Higdon's Novice 1 program, which was recommended to us on this subreddit (during the ten minutes my post was up before being deleted by moderators) - thanks! We stuck to the program and even made it a bit harder, running 18 km (three laps around the beautiful lake Jarun) for the last long run before pre-race taper. Unfortunately, after that run, my left ankle hurt real, real bad. I ran only once during that tapering week, just to see if the pain would still be there. It hurt a little but not much. \n\nThen came Saturday, the day before the race. I went to pick up the race package from the organizers, got a shirt and a backpack. My mother got really excited about us running the half, and bought me a running waist pack and four (!) energy gels for the race. I never wore the shirt before the half (not even a polyester shirt while running), and I never ran with the waist pack, nor tried an energy gel while training.\nI am a musician, and that evening, a musical collective that I'm part of had its ten year celebration. I played three concerts that night and drank four beers (2l). I ate a doner kebab in the most trashy fast food joint near the club I was playing at, and partied until 1am. In short, I did everything I was not supposed to do the night before!\n\nI woke up at 7:45 am, completely exhausted, sleep deprived and a bit hung over. I was scared to death about the half! Finding out I've got no coffee (which I drink every morning and always make sure NEVER to run out of coffee), I chugged a gel on an empty stomach. Fortunately, it didn't upset my body at all, but it was pretty disgusting. After cereal, I went to the race with my girlfriend. My old friend was waiting there too. \nThe second I came to the starting line, all negative feelings disappeared. The hangover, the kebab induced wind, the lack of caffeine, the fear of failure. I was happy as a baby! My girlfriend shot a video of me jumping, laughing and CLAPPING to myself while waiting for the race to start. And then it started.\n\nI just flew, radiant and light as a feather, through the course. The pace was easy. The shirt was fine. The waist pack was comfy and the gel didn't upset me. I wasn't dehydrated from the beer, nor hungover. My friend and I were talking to each other like it was any other weekday run.\n\nI can still remember nearly every moment of the race. I remember the overhyped start of the race with the organizer counting down to one. But after two minutes, when the race got going, silence and calm ensued. No loud, shallow EDM music, no shouting or euphoria, just hundreds of people doing step after step. This calming feeling made me realize something that I knew all along; that I consider running a meditative, peaceful practice, and that this month and a half of training for this race had done wonders to my mental health and well being. \nAfter 5 km I saw God. Well, it wasn't God actually, it was the Kenyan runner that was in first place, running in the opposite direction (because the course was a loop). The guy was so fast, I couldn't believe it. I felt absolute awe and joy because of his ability, speed and endurance. \n\nMy friend and I paced the race very very comfortably, and ran the last 8km much faster than the beginning. We started with a 6:30min/km pace, and ran the last 8km at a 5:40 pace or something like that. At the last two km, we felt that we had a lot of energy left, so we sprinted past, like, a hundred or two hundred runners who were easing into the finish line. We ran the last two km at a 4:30 pace, which we never even attempted during our training. Eventually we finished with a 2:09 time.\n\nSo, afterwards, I came home and immediately signed up for another half marathon. I felt absolutely relaxed, blissful because of the experience. Now, a week later, I feel so confident, so proud of myself, proud because this new, beautiful thing entered my life. My life got more structured and every day became more meaningful. I even revived a great friendship with a childhood friend through running! I haven't felt such joy about some activity since I started playing rock music 14 years ago.\n\nA propos the title of this post (which ended up much longer than I intended - sorry!), the day before I got a bit drunk, ate the worst food, and on race day I tried EVERYTHING new - and one advice that I see mentioned often on this sub is \"Nothing new on race day\". But I was so excited and so well prepared, by training properly, that none of it mattered!\n\nThanks for reading and congratulations for coming to the end of this colossal positive word vomit :) happy running!",

We immediately signed up for a half marathon five weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more we ran, the more we started to fall in love with long distance running, cherishing every evening when we would go and sweat and talk and talk mile after mile after mile. Our goal was just to finish the half marathon. We trained according to Hal Higdon&amp;#39;s Novice 1 program, which was recommended to us on this subreddit (during the ten minutes my post was up before being deleted by moderators) - thanks! We stuck to the program and even made it a bit harder, running 18 km (three laps around the beautiful lake Jarun) for the last long run before pre-race taper. Unfortunately, after that run, my left ankle hurt real, real bad. I ran only once during that tapering week, just to see if the pain would still be there. It hurt a little but not much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came Saturday, the day before the race. I went to pick up the race package from the organizers, got a shirt and a backpack. My mother got really excited about us running the half, and bought me a running waist pack and four (!) energy gels for the race. I never wore the shirt before the half (not even a polyester shirt while running), and I never ran with the waist pack, nor tried an energy gel while training.\nI am a musician, and that evening, a musical collective that I&amp;#39;m part of had its ten year celebration. I played three concerts that night and drank four beers (2l). I ate a doner kebab in the most trashy fast food joint near the club I was playing at, and partied until 1am. In short, I did everything I was not supposed to do the night before!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 7:45 am, completely exhausted, sleep deprived and a bit hung over. I was scared to death about the half! Finding out I&amp;#39;ve got no coffee (which I drink every morning and always make sure NEVER to run out of coffee), I chugged a gel on an empty stomach. Fortunately, it didn&amp;#39;t upset my body at all, but it was pretty disgusting. After cereal, I went to the race with my girlfriend. My old friend was waiting there too. \nThe second I came to the starting line, all negative feelings disappeared. The hangover, the kebab induced wind, the lack of caffeine, the fear of failure. I was happy as a baby! My girlfriend shot a video of me jumping, laughing and CLAPPING to myself while waiting for the race to start. And then it started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just flew, radiant and light as a feather, through the course. The pace was easy. The shirt was fine. The waist pack was comfy and the gel didn&amp;#39;t upset me. I wasn&amp;#39;t dehydrated from the beer, nor hungover. My friend and I were talking to each other like it was any other weekday run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can still remember nearly every moment of the race. I remember the overhyped start of the race with the organizer counting down to one. But after two minutes, when the race got going, silence and calm ensued. No loud, shallow EDM music, no shouting or euphoria, just hundreds of people doing step after step. This calming feeling made me realize something that I knew all along; that I consider running a meditative, peaceful practice, and that this month and a half of training for this race had done wonders to my mental health and well being. \nAfter 5 km I saw God. Well, it wasn&amp;#39;t God actually, it was the Kenyan runner that was in first place, running in the opposite direction (because the course was a loop). The guy was so fast, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. I felt absolute awe and joy because of his ability, speed and endurance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend and I paced the race very very comfortably, and ran the last 8km much faster than the beginning. We started with a 6:30min/km pace, and ran the last 8km at a 5:40 pace or something like that. At the last two km, we felt that we had a lot of energy left, so we sprinted past, like, a hundred or two hundred runners who were easing into the finish line. We ran the last two km at a 4:30 pace, which we never even attempted during our training. Eventually we finished with a 2:09 time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, afterwards, I came home and immediately signed up for another half marathon. I felt absolutely relaxed, blissful because of the experience. Now, a week later, I feel so confident, so proud of myself, proud because this new, beautiful thing entered my life. My life got more structured and every day became more meaningful. I even revived a great friendship with a childhood friend through running! I haven&amp;#39;t felt such joy about some activity since I started playing rock music 14 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A propos the title of this post (which ended up much longer than I intended - sorry!), the day before I got a bit drunk, ate the worst food, and on race day I tried EVERYTHING new - and one advice that I see mentioned often on this sub is &amp;quot;Nothing new on race day&amp;quot;. But I was so excited and so well prepared, by training properly, that none of it mattered!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and congratulations for coming to the end of this colossal positive word vomit :) happy running!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I 2014, I decided to take up running and trained for a spring 5k and a fall half-marathon. I put in 350 miles that year and felt really good about finishing a half-marathon at around 2:20:00. In the years after, we had kids, moved a bunch, and things got crazy. I would decide to start running again, but it wouldn't stick. I averaged about a run per month between 2015-2020. \n\nThis year, I really got motivated to become a runner again in January and I'm really proud of my commitment. I started Hal Higdon's Half Marathon Intermediate I after a little base building planning for a spring half-marathon. Life got in the way and I fell behind on the training, signed up for a 5k instead and started the plan over in April. I kept running, just not the mileage the plan called for.\n\nI decided to run the Purdue Half-Marathon and started the Higdon plan again in the summer. Once again, I couldn't keep up with the long runs and I knew I needed to reassess. So I checked out Jack Daniels' Running Formula from the library and read it cover-to-cover. I decided to progress through the training plans in there starting with Red and I just finished Phase I with no missed workouts. \n\nI have four previous 5k's under my belt, but I've always felt like I was too conservative. I was scared of pushing too hard and I never raced in school, so I didn't understand how to race. Even for my half-marathon, I finished thinking \"that wasn't too bad\", which probably means I wasn't running hard enough... For this race, I wanted to be really aggressive and push myself to the edge. So, my goal was to be puking at the finish line.\n\nPre-race\n\nI woke up at 5am, got ready, and had a Clif bar, banana, and cold brew coffee around 6am. I left the house at 7:30 and jogged to the stadium where the race was. My wife and kids showed up about ten minutes before the start and I handed her my sweatshirt, phone, etc.\n\nThe line up was kind of rough. It was very crowded and they did not organize by pace, so I knew I was too far back and the first few hundred meters was going to be rough.\n\nRace\n\nThe race started down a pretty steep hill and I actually had to jump up on a curve to get around the crowd, but I zoomed down the hill and the space cleared out by the time I was at the bottom. I actually felt kind of rough early on and started breathing heavy even though my pace was right were I wanted it. I started to think I was going out too fast, but about a half-mile in I started to feel more relaxed.\n\nAfter a turning a couple corners and weaving through a section of campus, we turned on to a main road and the rest of the race was pretty much uphill. I was just telling myself to keep my arms pumping and trying to stay relaxed, but run hard.\n\nAt 2.5 miles, I really started to feel it. I knew at that point that I was pushing myself to the brink. I found this lady in a yellow jacket and just tried to keep up with her.\n\nWe rounded the corner to the finish line with about 400 m left and I absolutely kicked it. I must have passed a dozen people in the last burst. When I crossed the finish line, I felt rough. This was the feeling that I was looking for. I knew I had given it all I had.\n\nPost-race\n\nMy wife was timing me and said I definitely beat 27:00 and Strava had it estimated at 26:10, so I knew I had beat my goal. The official time was 26:36.\n\nNow, I'm done racing for the year and I'm on to my long-term plans of finishing Daniels' training plans through Gold, running a Fall 2022 half-marathon, a 2023 marathon.\n\nMade with a new race report generator created by /u/herumph.",

The official time was 26:36.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m done racing for the year and I&amp;#39;m on to my long-term plans of finishing Daniels&amp;#39; training plans through Gold, running a Fall 2022 half-marathon, a 2023 marathon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made with a new race report generator created by &lt;a href=\"/u/herumph\"&gt;/u/herumph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I decided to start running again, and set up several targets that I wanted to hit by graduation in May. These ranged from completing a 5k run (basically inevitable if I kept with the habit) to earning a BQ (basically impossible). The most reasonable yet challenging were a HM, a 2:10 HM (which would be better than my inspiration for running), and a full. I started and completed C25K, ramped up to 10k, then started HM training. I didn't follow a plan, though I did base my plan heavily off of Hal Higdon's HM plans.\n\n## Pre-race\n\n3 weeks prior to the race, I inflamed my IT band. I swapped completely to cross-training (swimming is really fun) and saw a doctor about the issue. He cleared my for the race and said I could run for training unless I felt the pain start to flare. I brought my distance up to 4 miles the week before race (while supplementing with cross-training), then followed my taper down. That said, this lack of running in the 3 weeks before race day did make me nervous.\n\n## Race\n\nI started way too far back, and had to pass too many people over the first bit (post-race info would confirm that I passed over 1,000 people between the start and the first split at 7k). The first 10k felt fine. I was enjoying the atmosphere and feeling really good at the race. I'm not sure if it's the long climb starting at 10k or fatigue that hit me, but suddenly I had to stop and walk for longer than I would have liked. Eventually I got running again, and I don't remember much of the rest of the race. I even passed by a major landmark in the town which I have no recollection of passing. My one memory is deciding to run hard for the last mile, and I ended up setting a 1M PB in my last mile of a HM. The first 10k would also be a 10k PB for me, but that was expected as my previous PB was from a time trial gone horribly wrong.\n\nI also want to compliment the race coordinators. The race was well-organized, well-plotted, and the timing was excellent. The weather (though clearly not in their hands) was also brilliant, though maybe a touch too cold, and contributed to a great race atmosphere.\n\n## Post-race\n\nComing from Humans vs Zombies, my legs are very used to sprinting while tired (we quite commonly do 10-25 mi walking in one day, and will occasionally need to do 1 min hard sprints during that). As a result, it was funny though not unexpected to feel my legs want to sprint about 10 mins after finishing. I guess that's just how my body is trained to operate when exhausted. After collecting everything and heading out, I went to Outback Steakhouse with the family (which I maintain is inferior to Texas Roadhouse in every way) and went to see Halloween Kills (which was significantly worse than it's prequel). Then a long nap. All in all, kinda a bummer way to finish a day after such a fun event.\n\nNow, this may be the most sore I've ever been, though it does feel like merely muscular soreness. I'm already considering what my next major goal should be. The 2:10 HM is now very achievable in my mind, as is the full marathon. That said, I'm also tempted to work on some shorter-distance work (maybe try to lower my 5k below 28:00 or even 27:00) or even pivoting to an olympic triathlon or half ironman. If anyone has thoughts, I'd love to hear them.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I'm doing a mix of Hal Higdon and my local running group's home grown plan.  3 weeks ago I was in a walking boot for some tennovitis in my ankle.  I'd been building back up slowly, and this week was my first 30 mile week (including the half).\n\nMy running group has fast track workouts, a tempo run on Wednesdays and a slower long run...to keep miles up I also run a couple of solos.  I had been steadily lowering my pace over time and it culminated in my fastest week of work.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nI got a total of about 5 hours of sleep.  I had a smoke alarm start chirping about its battery at 4:10am...and that was it for me.  I schlepped around the house for about an hour before getting ready and heading out.  The morning was a crisp 50 degrees and perfect for a jog.  I met up my group for a pre-race picture and got ready to go.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe half started at 7, so we all stood in the corral starting at 6:45 while the MC went over the house keeping.  2 minutes before go time, I fist bumped my cohorts and started trying to lock in..  I was honestly just hoping for about a 10 minute pace...but the adrenaline of the race and the crowd was pushing me along much faster than I thought I'd be able to maintain.\n\nI kept a mental image of everybody passing me a spite fuel for later:).  After about 4 miles I was honestly surprised I hadn't faded and got myself a bit of confidence.  I did choke on a gummy bear at 4.5, but I survived to keep running!\n\nThe last half of the race was full of long sloping hills that are just brutal if you're not used to them.  Luckily as a bigger dude, I've got power for days and I was able to take them with almost no slowdown.\n\nAfter about mile 8, I was starting to catch (and then pass) all the runners who zipped past me at the beginning...each of those victories were very sweet, and I hope just a little demoralizing to the little skinny young pups getting passed by a 42 year old 250lb dude.  I say all this in jest...I held no ill will for anybody out there with me...I was honestly just trying to make sure I finished.\n\nThe last mile I finally started fading noticeably.  After refilling and refueling at every aid station, I was still starting to feel the beginnings of a cramp in my left calf and I had to back off some.\n\nAs I rounded the last corner, I \"sprinted\" like I was on fire.  In reality, I'm sure it was just a big blob of sweaty flesh coming down the tunnel in a slightly faster pace than before, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt a little like Forrest Gump.\n\nI finished the race under 2 hours and I honestly didn't think I'd be even close when I started training for this.  I'm proud of where Ive gotten and I'm more determined than ever to go for the full in a couple of months.  Every milestone along the race was a PR for me today.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nMy main training buddy (who finished a full 10 minutes faster) hung around to take pictures with me by finish line, and then we joined the beer line (I mean, Oktoberfest...it's basically mandatory).  We hung around for a while and cheered on the rest of our group to the finish.  I ate lots of gummy bears and bananas (couldn't bring myself to grab a shepherd's pie ) and layed in the sun for a while.\n\nI've spent the rest of the day (today) walking slowly, hydrating, and trying to keep my hips and legs from locking up.  I'm sure tomorrow's going to be super fun.  Not sure there's enough ice and advil for the aches I'll wake up :)\n\nMade with a new\u00a0race report generator\u00a0created by /u/herumph.",

Since I started, on good weeks I could run thrice a week with an average of 14 km. However, I&amp;#39;ve observed that whenever my mood/general feeling turns melancholy or borderline depressive (cant really say, never been diagnosed), my runs go down to at least one run a week and I&amp;#39;m feeling pressure to increase my number of runs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When this happens, of course it would take time again to bounce back to my normal fitness. I really want to improve my running but yeah when those feelings come I just can&amp;#39;t run as much as I know I actually can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have this problem? Do you have any advice or tips that I can do? Thank you so much for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
