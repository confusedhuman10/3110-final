[Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.\n\n2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.\n\n2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.\n\n**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**\n\n* Create an [FSA account](https://www.fsaid.ed.gov) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.\n\n* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.\n\n* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.\n\nDo not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",

          "selftext": "I figured since this is probably a fairly common problem people face, I'd post it here. If it's not allowed feel free to remove it.\n\nI'm 21, male, in my final undergraduate year at university in the US, I'm studying Economics, finance, and law, and I've been interning in finance jobs and have been applying to full-time roles in the area for next summer. Recently though I realized that working in finance is just about the last thing I want to do with my life. I don't want to sit at a desk for 12 hours a day working in investment banking, or asset management, in fact nothing sounds worse. I also realized I have had no enjoyment or intellectual stimulation in university for the last 3.5 years. I think I always liked the idea of working hard in a complex field but now that it's so close I don't want to do it at all.\n\nThis realization caused me to have a few anxiety attacks, and I am planning on seeing a therapist (never been to therapy before) to talk about it. I don't know what to do, I'm supposed to graduate next semester but I feel like I've wasted these four years of my life studying something I don't want to do. The thing is, I don't even know what I WOULD want to do; a part of me wants to pursue other passions like acting, and another part of me just has no idea what I want to do, I just know I DON'T want to work in finance. Also, please don't interpret this as just a college student being lazy and not wanting to work; I definitely to want to leave school as soon as I can and work but I just don't know in what field. My parents are expecting me to graduate but I'm fairly sure they'd allow me to stay another year at university if I want to, especially if I explain this to them.\n\nThat being said, I don't know if staying in uni longer to try to find my passion is just kicking the can down the road. If anyone has any advice on this, or if you've been in a similar situation, I am open to anything right now. I've never experienced this kind of existential dread before and I'm looking for any direction to go in. Sorry this was super long, thank you in advance.",

If it&amp;#39;s not allowed feel free to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21, male, in my final undergraduate year at university in the US, I&amp;#39;m studying Economics, finance, and law, and I&amp;#39;ve been interning in finance jobs and have been applying to full-time roles in the area for next summer. Recently though I realized that working in finance is just about the last thing I want to do with my life. I don&amp;#39;t want to sit at a desk for 12 hours a day working in investment banking, or asset management, in fact nothing sounds worse. I also realized I have had no enjoyment or intellectual stimulation in university for the last 3.5 years. I think I always liked the idea of working hard in a complex field but now that it&amp;#39;s so close I don&amp;#39;t want to do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This realization caused me to have a few anxiety attacks, and I am planning on seeing a therapist (never been to therapy before) to talk about it. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I&amp;#39;m supposed to graduate next semester but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve wasted these four years of my life studying something I don&amp;#39;t want to do. The thing is, I don&amp;#39;t even know what I WOULD want to do; a part of me wants to pursue other passions like acting, and another part of me just has no idea what I want to do, I just know I DON&amp;#39;T want to work in finance. Also, please don&amp;#39;t interpret this as just a college student being lazy and not wanting to work; I definitely to want to leave school as soon as I can and work but I just don&amp;#39;t know in what field. My parents are expecting me to graduate but I&amp;#39;m fairly sure they&amp;#39;d allow me to stay another year at university if I want to, especially if I explain this to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don&amp;#39;t know if staying in uni longer to try to find my passion is just kicking the can down the road. If anyone has any advice on this, or if you&amp;#39;ve been in a similar situation, I am open to anything right now. I&amp;#39;ve never experienced this kind of existential dread before and I&amp;#39;m looking for any direction to go in. Sorry this was super long, thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo basically it happened that I recently experienced an unjust treatment from a professor. However, let me give you some context on how it happened : (sorry if it is lengthy)\n\nI had a physics exam inside a huge auditorium that contained approximatively 100 students.  Strangely enough, there was only one professor to supervise the whole auditorium (other people where supposed to help but they did not come). Throughout the exam all went well. However, it is when the time to submit the papers came that things turned ugly. You might already guess that it is not a good idea to have one supervising person over a 100 students. Basically, what happened is that many students stood up and were going with their papers towards a table at the end of the auditorium. Intuitively, I thought that I should submit my paper there (it was 6 meters/ 20 feet away from me). As I'm going there I stopped halfway to put my answer sheet inside my question sheet (the paper was so bulky that I had support it with my knee). At that moment that professor was in panic mode because of the number of students freely walking around and casually chatting with their papers still in hand. I could hear him in the background shouting to other students : \"You got minus 10 ! you got minus 10 !\". Basically as I was putting my answer sheet in my question sheet ( which is a 5 seconds timeframe), he approaches me and asks me  what I am doing, to which I replied: \"I'm putting the paper inside\". At that moment he takes my paper, turns around, and says \"you got minus 10\". I became sure that 10 points out of a hundred would be deducted from me as he only took in hands the papers of the students to which he said : \"You got minus 10\". \n\nWhat that professor did is that he downgraded my grade by a letter grade. If it was an A , it would become B and if it was a B , it would become C, and so on. \n\nI wrote all the text above in such details just to illustrate that I did nothing wrong. I directly wanted to submit my paper after the time was up. That professor  had no valid reason for deducting points. I feel he did that out of anger that he had towards everyone in the room. \n\nNow I e-mailed my teaching professor about the incident (in an appropriate way)  and that I would hope that points would not be deducted. I didn't get any response for a week. What worries me is that this supervising professor is a head of department and has more authority. He was very determined to deduct grades.\n\nIt is very devastating for me because it is a very important exam. What do you think I should do ? It seems my teaching professor can't do anything. I will try talking with that head of department, but what should I do if he refuses ? To whom should I appeal ?",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically it happened that I recently experienced an unjust treatment from a professor. However, let me give you some context on how it happened : (sorry if it is lengthy)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a physics exam inside a huge auditorium that contained approximatively 100 students.  Strangely enough, there was only one professor to supervise the whole auditorium (other people where supposed to help but they did not come). Throughout the exam all went well. However, it is when the time to submit the papers came that things turned ugly. You might already guess that it is not a good idea to have one supervising person over a 100 students. Basically, what happened is that many students stood up and were going with their papers towards a table at the end of the auditorium. Intuitively, I thought that I should submit my paper there (it was 6 meters/ 20 feet away from me). As I&amp;#39;m going there I stopped halfway to put my answer sheet inside my question sheet (the paper was so bulky that I had support it with my knee). At that moment that professor was in panic mode because of the number of students freely walking around and casually chatting with their papers still in hand. I could hear him in the background shouting to other students : &amp;quot;You got minus 10 ! you got minus 10 !&amp;quot;. Basically as I was putting my answer sheet in my question sheet ( which is a 5 seconds timeframe), he approaches me and asks me  what I am doing, to which I replied: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m putting the paper inside&amp;quot;. At that moment he takes my paper, turns around, and says &amp;quot;you got minus 10&amp;quot;. I became sure that 10 points out of a hundred would be deducted from me as he only took in hands the papers of the students to which he said : &amp;quot;You got minus 10&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What that professor did is that he downgraded my grade by a letter grade. If it was an A , it would become B and if it was a B , it would become C, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote all the text above in such details just to illustrate that I did nothing wrong. I directly wanted to submit my paper after the time was up. That professor  had no valid reason for deducting points. I feel he did that out of anger that he had towards everyone in the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I e-mailed my teaching professor about the incident (in an appropriate way)  and that I would hope that points would not be deducted. I didn&amp;#39;t get any response for a week. What worries me is that this supervising professor is a head of department and has more authority. He was very determined to deduct grades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is very devastating for me because it is a very important exam. What do you think I should do ? It seems my teaching professor can&amp;#39;t do anything. I will try talking with that head of department, but what should I do if he refuses ? To whom should I appeal ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They are: the ability to take a break/leave class and come back, and I have flexible attendance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got my accommodations a few weeks ago, but regardless, I have been extremely good about attending my government professor's class this semester (he offers 10 unexcused days, I used one before accommodations) and I used my first accommodation day last Monday. I'm sick again today and I emailed him about an hour before class (my advisor told me at least thirty minutes before) to let him know and ask what I should go over to be aptly prepared for Wednesday. He emailed me back within five minutes saying this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it happens, I am currently accommodating another student so you can log onto the Collaborate session and participate from there. If you do so, I will count your attendance. If not, I will count the absence as unexcused unless it requires a doctor's visit or your symptoms are similar to COVID. Or, if you want to fail the wellness screening which will initiate a COVID accommodation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have to go to the doctor for my accommodation absence to count, and I don't have COVID so I'm obviously not getting tested or failing the screening. But, I do understand that attendance flexibility can be a tricky thing for a professor. So, what can I say in response to this? I'm attending online today, and I'm glad to have the option, but I guess I feel like I should say something to him about my accommodations because of how he phrased everything? I can't even tell if what he said technically violates my accommodations, and he's typically a chill guy so I don't want to immediately bring it up with the Disability Service. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I should email him and remind him that I have accommodations, but I can't even imagine how I would phrase that and I'm not even sure if I should.

They are: the ability to take a break/leave class and come back, and I have flexible attendance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally got my accommodations a few weeks ago, but regardless, I have been extremely good about attending my government professor&amp;#39;s class this semester (he offers 10 unexcused days, I used one before accommodations) and I used my first accommodation day last Monday. I&amp;#39;m sick again today and I emailed him about an hour before class (my advisor told me at least thirty minutes before) to let him know and ask what I should go over to be aptly prepared for Wednesday. He emailed me back within five minutes saying this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I am currently accommodating another student so you can log onto the Collaborate session and participate from there. If you do so, I will count your attendance. If not, I will count the absence as unexcused unless it requires a doctor&amp;#39;s visit or your symptoms are similar to COVID. Or, if you want to fail the wellness screening which will initiate a COVID accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have to go to the doctor for my accommodation absence to count, and I don&amp;#39;t have COVID so I&amp;#39;m obviously not getting tested or failing the screening. But, I do understand that attendance flexibility can be a tricky thing for a professor. So, what can I say in response to this? I&amp;#39;m attending online today, and I&amp;#39;m glad to have the option, but I guess I feel like I should say something to him about my accommodations because of how he phrased everything? I can&amp;#39;t even tell if what he said technically violates my accommodations, and he&amp;#39;s typically a chill guy so I don&amp;#39;t want to immediately bring it up with the Disability Service. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should email him and remind him that I have accommodations, but I can&amp;#39;t even imagine how I would phrase that and I&amp;#39;m not even sure if I should. Should I just leave it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
